# Home Assistant Control Tool for OpenWebUI

This tool connects OpenWebUI to a Home Assistant instance, allowing a Large Language Model (LLM) to control and query smart home devices using natural, human-readable language.

## Installation

1.  Place the `home_assistant_tool.py` and `requirements.txt` files into your OpenWebUI `tools` directory.
2.  The OpenWebUI backend will automatically install the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Configuration

This tool requires a **Long-Lived Access Token** from your Home Assistant instance. You can create one in your Home Assistant profile under `Security > Long-Lived Access Tokens`.

There are two ways to configure the tool:

### 1. OpenWebUI Settings (Recommended)

After the tool is loaded, you can configure it directly in the OpenWebUI interface:
1.  Go to `Settings > Tools`.
2.  Find the "Home Assistant Controls" tool.
3.  Enter your **Home Assistant URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8123`) and your **Home Assistant API Key** (the Long-Lived Access Token).
4.  To enable printing, enter the name of your printer's notify service in the **Home Assistant Printer Notify Service** field (e.g., `my_cups_printer`).
5.  To enable alarm control, enter your **Home Assistant Alarm Code** if your system requires one.

> **Note on Printer Setup:** To use the printing feature, you must first have a printer integration configured in Home Assistant that creates a `notify` service. A common example is the CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) integration.

### 2. Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can configure the tool by setting environment variables on the server where OpenWebUI is running. This is useful for containerized setups like Docker.

```bash
export HA_URL="http://your-home-assistant-ip:8123"
export HA_API_KEY="your-long-lived-access-token"
export HA_ALARM_CODE="your-alarm-code"
export HA_PRINTER_NOTIFY_SERVICE="my_cups_printer"
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with your Home Assistant devices in your chat with the LLM:

- `"Turn on the living room lamp."`
- `"Please turn off the bedroom fan."`
- `"Is the coffee machine on?"`
- `"Open the garage door."`
- `"What is the status of the garage door?"`
- `"Change the TV source to HDMI 2."`
- `"What's playing on the living room speaker?"`
- `"Show me the latest error logs."`
- `"Unlock the back door."`
- `"Is the front door locked?"`
- `"Is the back door window open?"`
- `"What is the humidity in the basement?"`
- `"What's my internet speed?"`
- `"What is the status of the robot vacuum?"`
- `"What's the status of the Synology NAS?"`
- `"Add 'Buy milk' to the shopping list."`
- `"What's on my to-do list?"`
- `"What is the status of the alarm?"`
- `"Tell the robot vacuum to start cleaning."`
- `"Where is Jane?"`
- `"Are there any notifications?"`
- `"Pause the living room speaker and set the volume to 30%."`
- `"Set the office lamp to 50% brightness and make it a warm white."`
- `"Activate the 'Movie Time' scene."`
- `"Set the thermostat to 72 degrees and put it in heat mode."`
- `"Trigger the 'Good Morning' automation."`
- `"What's the status of the thermostat?"`
- `"What's the weather forecast?"`
- `"What scenes are available?"`
- `"What are the available sources for the Living Room TV?"`
- `"List all of the lights."`
- `"Disable the 'Turn on porch light at sunset' automation."`
- `"Hey, shut off all the lights in the kitchen."` (Note: This requires a "Kitchen Lights" group or device in Home Assistant).

## Architectural Limitations

This tool interacts with Home Assistant via its official REST API, which is designed for controlling and querying the state of existing devices and entities. It is intentionally sandboxed from making deep configuration changes for security and stability reasons.

Therefore, this tool **cannot** perform tasks such as:

- **Creating or Deleting Areas:** Managing areas must be done in the Home Assistant UI.
- **Adding or Removing Device Integrations:** Setting up new hardware or cloud integrations is a UI-driven process.
- **Creating Complex New Automations:** While the tool can enable, disable, and trigger existing automations, creating new automations with multiple triggers and conditions from scratch should be done in the Automation Editor in Home Assistant.

For these types of setup and configuration tasks, you should always use the Home Assistant user interface.
